# Car Showroom Analytics

## Project Overview
This project is an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** performed on a car showroom dataset. The goal is to **analyze customer and sales data**, uncover patterns in car purchases, and generate actionable insights to improve showroom performance. The project includes **data cleaning and exploration in Python** and **visualizations in Power BI**.

## Project Contents
- **Data Folder**: Contains raw and cleaned sales and customer datasets  
- **Python Notebook**: Performs data cleaning, preprocessing, and basic analysis using **NumPy, Pandas, and Regular Expressions (re)**  
- **Power BI Images**: Visualizations showing sales trends, customer behavior, and showroom insights  

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends  
- Basic analysis using Python libraries (**NumPy, Pandas, re**)  
- Visualizations in **Power BI** to support business decisions  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, re)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (if any Python visuals)  
- Power BI for interactive dashboards and graphs  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Future Work
- Integrate predictive models (e.g., regression or classification) to forecast sales or customer behavior  
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards for showroom management  
- Add automated reporting for management insights
